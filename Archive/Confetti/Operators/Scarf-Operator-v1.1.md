# 📘 **Scarf Operator — NDH‑Triadic‑Core v1.1**  
**Holonomy‑Safe Parallel Transport Operator**

---

## **1. Purpose**

The **Scarf Operator** defines holonomy‑safe parallel transport of tensors along smooth curves in the NDH manifold.  
It ensures that transport occurs only when:

- holonomy deviation is within bounds  
- curvature remains stable along the path  
- the stability envelope is satisfied  
- drift remains below the maximum permitted threshold  

Scarf governs all tensor movement within the NDH Stability Manifold.

---

## **2. Formal Definition**

Let:

- \( \mathcal{M} \) be the NDH manifold  
- \( \gamma : [0,1] \to \mathcal{M} \) a smooth curve  
- \( T_0 \) a tensor at \( \gamma(0) \)  
- \( \nabla \) the manifold connection  
- \( \mathcal{H}(x) \) the holonomy field  
- \( S(x) \) the stability envelope  

Define the Scarf Operator:

\[
\mathcal{S}_{\text{scarf}}(\gamma, T_0) =
\begin{cases}
T(1) & \text{if } \nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)} T(t) = 0,\;
\|\mathcal{H}(\gamma(t))\| \le H_{\max},\;
S(\gamma(t)) \ge S_{\min} \\
\text{undefined} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Where:

- \( T(t) \) is the parallel‑transported tensor  
- holonomy deviation must remain below \( H_{\max} \)  
- stability must remain above \( S_{\min} \)  

---

## **3. Mathematical Constraints**

### **3.1 Parallel Transport Condition**

\[
\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)} T(t) = 0
\]

Ensures tensor continuity along the path.

---

### **3.2 Holonomy Bound**

\[
\|\mathcal{H}(\gamma(t))\| \le H_{\max}
\quad \forall t \in [0,1]
\]

Ensures holonomy deviation remains within safe limits.

---

### **3.3 Stability Envelope Condition**

\[
S(\gamma(t)) \ge S_{\min}
\quad \forall t
\]

Ensures transport occurs only within the stability envelope.

---

### **3.4 Drift Bound**

Let drift be:

\[
D(\gamma) = \max_{t \in [0,1]} |S(\gamma(t)) - S(\gamma(0))|
\]

Scarf requires:

\[
D(\gamma) \le D_{\max}
\]

Ensures stability continuity along the path.

## **4. Operator Relationships**

### **Manifold Operator → Scarf**
Provides:

- connection \( \nabla \)  
- holonomy field \( \mathcal{H} \)  
- stability envelope \( S(x) \)  

Scarf reads these quantities.

---

### **Stability Manifold → Scarf**
Provides:

- drift bounds  
- stability basins  
- operator‑safe region  

Transport is permitted only within stability basins.

---

### **Crane → Scarf**
Crane determines event permission at the path endpoints.

Scarf requires Crane permission at:

- \( \gamma(0) \)  
- \( \gamma(1) \)

---

### **Scarf → Confetti**
Confetti activation must not violate Scarf path stability.

---

## **5. Version Notes (v1.1)**

This version introduces:

- explicit drift bounds  
- strengthened holonomy constraints  
- explicit endpoint Crane‑permission requirement  
- integration with NDH Stability Manifold v1.0  
- alignment with Unified Operator v1.0  

These changes ensure NDH v1.1 stability compliance.

## **6. Provenance Footer**

---
Provenance: This archived version of Scarf-Operator-v1.1 is preserved as a
Confetti-state artifact following the NDH-Triadic-Core cleanup process. It
contains contamination introduced during the Confetti incident and is not part
of the active NDH mathematical manifold. The clean Scarf-Operator-v1.1 is
restored within NDH-Triadic-Core and supersedes this version.

All Confetti-state artifacts are maintained in Zen-AI-Design-Architecture for
expressive and historical lineage continuity.
