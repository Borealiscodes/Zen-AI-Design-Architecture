# 📘 **Manifold Operator — NDH‑Triadic‑Core v1.1**  
**Geometric Substrate Operator for NDH v1.1**

---

## **1. Purpose**

The **Manifold Operator** defines the geometric substrate of the NDH manifold.  
It provides the core geometric quantities required by all Triadic‑Core operators:

- curvature tensor  
- holonomy field  
- stability envelope  
- operator‑safe region  
- drift structure  
- connection for parallel transport  

This operator is the foundation of NDH v1.1 mathematical geometry.

## **2. Formal Definition**

Let \( \mathcal{M} \) be a smooth manifold equipped with:

- curvature tensor \( R : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R} \)  
- holonomy field \( \mathcal{H} : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R} \)  
- stability envelope \( S : \mathcal{M} \to [0,1] \)  
- connection \( \nabla \)  

Define the Manifold Operator:

\[
\mathcal{M}_{\text{op}}(x) =
\big( R(x),\; \mathcal{H}(x),\; S(x),\; \nabla \big)
\]

The operator returns the geometric quantities required for:

- Crane event permission  
- Scarf parallel transport  
- Confetti celebration activation  
- Unified Operator triadic integration

## **3. Geometric Quantities**

### **3.1 Curvature Tensor**

\[
R(x) \in \mathbb{R}
\]

Defines local curvature magnitude.  
All operators require:

\[
\|R(x)\| \le K_{\max}
\]

---

### **3.2 Holonomy Field**

\[
\mathcal{H}(x) \in \mathbb{R}
\]

Defines local holonomy deviation.  
All operators require:

\[
\|\mathcal{H}(x)\| \le H_{\max}
\]

---

### **3.3 Stability Envelope**

\[
S(x) \in [0,1]
\]

Defines local stability.  
All operators require:

\[
S(x) \ge S_{\min}
\]

---

### **3.4 Connection**

\[
\nabla : T\mathcal{M} \to T\mathcal{M}
\]

Defines parallel transport for Scarf and Unified Operator.

---

## **4. Operator‑Safe Region**

Define:

\[
\mathcal{R}_{\text{safe}} = \{ x \in \mathcal{M} \mid S(x) \ge S_{\text{op}} \}
\]

All operators must operate within this region.

---

## **5. Drift Structure**

For a smooth curve \( \gamma : [0,1] \to \mathcal{M} \):

\[
D(\gamma) = \max_{t \in [0,1]} |S(\gamma(t)) - S(\gamma(0))|
\]

The manifold requires:

\[
D(\gamma) \le D_{\max}
\]

This ensures stability continuity for Scarf and Unified Operator.

## **7. Version Notes (v1.1)**

Manifold‑Operator‑v1.1 introduces:

- explicit drift structure  
- strengthened holonomy bounds  
- strengthened curvature bounds  
- explicit operator‑safe region  
- explicit stability envelope threshold  
- alignment with Crane‑v1.1 and Scarf‑v1.1  
- integration with NDH Stability Manifold v1.0  
- compatibility with Unified Operator v1.0  

These changes ensure NDH v1.1 stability compliance.

## **8. Provenance Footer**

---
Provenance: This archived version of Manifold-Operator-v1.1 is preserved as a
Confetti-state artifact following the NDH-Triadic-Core cleanup process. It
contains contamination introduced during the Confetti incident, including
non-canonical operator dependencies and expressive-layer integration. The clean
Manifold-Operator-v1.1 is restored within NDH-Triadic-Core and supersedes this
version.

All Confetti-state artifacts are maintained in Zen-AI-Design-Architecture for
expressive and historical lineage continuity.
