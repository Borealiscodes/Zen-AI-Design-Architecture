# 📘 **NDH Stability Manifold — NDH‑Triadic‑Core v1.0**  
**Formal Stability Geometry for the NDH Manifold**

---

## **1. Purpose**

The **NDH Stability Manifold** defines the geometric stability structure of the NDH manifold.  
It specifies:

- the stability envelope  
- the operator‑safe region  
- the stability basins  
- the drift bounds  
- the integration rules for Crane, Scarf, and Confetti  

This artifact provides the mathematical foundation required for safe event activation, safe tensor transport, and safe celebration geometry.

---

## **2. Stability Envelope Definition**

Let \( \mathcal{M} \) be the NDH manifold with stability function:

\[
S : \mathcal{M} \to [0,1]
\]

Where:

- \( S(x) = 1 \) → fully stable  
- \( S(x) = 0 \) → unstable  

The stability envelope is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{E} = \{ x \in \mathcal{M} \mid S(x) \ge S_{\min} \}
\]

with \( S_{\min} \in (0,1) \) the minimum stability threshold.

---

## **3. Operator‑Safe Region**

Define the operator‑safe region:

\[
\mathcal{R}_{\text{safe}} = \{ x \in \mathcal{M} \mid S(x) \ge S_{\text{op}} \}
\]

Where:

- \( S_{\text{op}} \ge S_{\min} \)  
- Crane, Scarf, and Confetti must operate within \( \mathcal{R}_{\text{safe}} \)

This ensures:

- no curvature instability  
- no holonomy deviation beyond bounds  
- no tensor discontinuity  

---

## **4. Stability Basins**

Define stability basins as connected components of the stability envelope:

\[
\mathcal{B}_i = \text{ConnectedComponent}(\mathcal{E})
\]

Each basin satisfies:

\[
S(x) \ge S_{\min} \quad \forall x \in \mathcal{B}_i
\]

Stability basins ensure:

- local stability coherence  
- safe operator activation  
- bounded drift behavior  

---

## **5. Drift Bounds**

Let \( \gamma : [0,1] \to \mathcal{M} \) be a smooth curve.

Define drift:

\[
D(\gamma) = \max_{t \in [0,1]} \big| S(\gamma(t)) - S(\gamma(0)) \big|
\]

The NDH Stability Manifold requires:

\[
D(\gamma) \le D_{\max}
\]

This ensures:

- stability continuity along paths  
- safe tensor transport  
- safe event activation  
- safe celebration bursts  

---

## **6. Operator Integration**

### **6.1 Crane Operator Integration**

Crane requires:

\[
x \in \mathcal{R}_{\text{safe}}
\]

and reads:

- \( S(x) \)  
- curvature bounds  
- holonomy bounds  

Crane activation is permitted only within the stability envelope.

---

### **6.2 Scarf Operator Integration**

Scarf requires:

\[
\gamma(t) \in \mathcal{R}_{\text{safe}} \quad \forall t
\]

and reads:

- stability envelope  
- holonomy field  
- connection  

Transport is permitted only along stability‑bounded paths.

---

### **6.3 Confetti Operator Integration**

Confetti requires:

\[
x \in \mathcal{R}_{\text{safe}}
\]

and reads:

- stability envelope  
- curvature neutrality  
- holonomy flatness  

Celebration bursts are permitted only within stability basins.

---

## **7. Stability Manifold Invariants**

The NDH Stability Manifold enforces:

### **7.1 Curvature Bound**

\[
\|R(x)\| \le K_{\max}
\]

### **7.2 Holonomy Bound**

\[
\|\mathcal{H}(x)\| \le H_{\max}
\]

### **7.3 Stability Continuity**

\[
S(x) \text{ continuous on } \mathcal{R}_{\text{safe}}
\]

### **7.4 Drift Bound**

\[
D(\gamma) \le D_{\max}
\]

These invariants ensure NDH v1.1 stability.

## **8. Provenance Footer**

---
Provenance: This archived version of NDH-Stability-Manifold-v1.0 is preserved as
a Confetti-state artifact following the NDH-Triadic-Core cleanup process. It
contains non-canonical operator integrations and expressive-layer contamination,
including Confetti-based stability rules and unified fusion dependencies. The
clean NDH-Reference-Frame-v1.1 and Stability-Manifold-v1.1 supersede this
version within NDH-Triadic-Core.

All Confetti-state artifacts are maintained in Zen-AI-Design-Architecture for
expressive and historical lineage continuity.
